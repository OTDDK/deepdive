[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), a layer-0 platform, provides a secure and unified ecosystem for specialized blockchains known as parachains. These [parachains](https://parachains.info/) are separate layer-1 blockchains that run alongside each other on the Polkadot network and are connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain, accessible through [auction](https://parachains.info/auctions)-based allocation. Running a parachain on Polkadot offers numerous advantages, including shared security, increased scalability, enhanced interoperability, and collaborative governance. Additionally, the cross-chain composability feature of Polkadot enables seamless transfer of any type of data or asset between parachains, unlocking vast potential for new use cases and applications.

In 2022, the OriginTrail Decentralized Network has adopted a new Blockchain implementation, a Parachain through Polkadot auctions, NeuroWebAI (NEURO). OriginTrail was successful in winning the [**Polkadot Parachain auction slot #17**](https://parachains.info/details/origintrail) in May 2022, and has since then been collaborating closely with the [Parity Technology team, who joined the Trace Alliance](https://medium.com/origintrail/parity-technologies-joins-trace-alliances-working-group-on-decentralization-and-tokenomics-8eaad2843ca7). Additionally, the OriginTrail core development team was chosen for the [the Substrate Builders program](https://www.substrate.io/builders-program/) by Parity Technologies.

OriginTrail combines the power of **Knowledge Graphs** and **Blockchains** to create an open protocol. However, it's important to note that **OriginTrail is not a blockchain** itself; but rather a decentralized network that operates off-chain and in conjunction with the blockchain layer. It has been designed to be interoperable with any blockchain and to act as a complementary middleware solution, addressing the issue of **data interconnectivity**. As a **layer-2 multichain and agnostic protocol**, OriginTrail can be integrated with any blockchain. Currently, the OriginTrail V6 decentralized protocol is live on NeuroWebAI (formally known as OriginTrail Parachain) and Gnosis.

There has been significant developments within the OriginTrail ecosystem since the launch of the Metcalfe Genesis phase in October 2023. Since then, the DKG has seen remarkable growth, with over 3 million Knowledge Assets published by the end of 2023, and new partners joining to foster real-world adoption and address misinformation across sectors.

In 2024, the OriginTrail DKG is poised for significant progress, leading up to the launch of DKG V8. This phase is marked by the establishment of three impact bases inspired by Isaac Asimov's works, aimed at pioneering a future where knowledge and innovation merge:

1. **Trantor** (Q1 2024): Highlights the Library of Trantor, focusing on indexing human knowledge. The beta launch of Knowledge Mining introduces a process for creating high-quality, blockchain-tracked knowledge, with an initial NEURO token pool available for miners. This initiative utilizes both NeuroWeb (a parachain on Polkadot) and Gnosis blockchains, aiming to evolve knowledge creation across various fields.
2. **Terminus** (Q2 2024): With a founding population focused on publishing the Encyclopedia Galactica, this base emphasizes technological advancements and high-efficiency tech due to limited natural resources. Key developments include a random sampling module for increased Knowledge Asset throughput and a multichain growth strategy to enhance the DKG's scalability and integration with various blockchains.
3. **Gaia** (H2 2024): This base explores the evolution of a telepathic group consciousness extending to the entire planet, symbolizing the integration of AI-powered Autonomous Knowledge Mining. This initiative aims to enable a range of autonomous activities, such as discovering inferences and mining new knowledge, through AI-native capabilities.

These impact bases form the V8 Foundation, focusing on core areas to achieve an effective DKG V8 launch. The post emphasizes the importance of these developments in enhancing the DKG's functionality and adoption, without delving into specific technological integrations, governmental support, or other adoption updates. The overall goal is to stay on TRAC(k) with the OriginTrail ecosystem's expansion and innovation trajectory.
