As of Nov. 19th, 2021, one day after Acala won the first Polkadot auction parachain ever, OriginTrail and Acala announced a [partnership](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1461686575566409730?s=20) by integrating the Decentralized Knowledge Graph on Acala, allowing physical and digital assets within the DKG to be queryable and indexable among other things. Branimir, co-Founder of OriginTrail and CTO, alongside Dan Reecer, Acala VP of Growth, discuss what a DKG is, and how Acala ecosystem developers will leverage it.

In a nutshell, the integration goes in two ways. First, Acala will become another chain OriginTrail extends to, making the DKG accessible. Second, the rest of Polkadotâ€™s ecosystem as well as anyone using Acala will get access to the DKG to query and publish data to it.
