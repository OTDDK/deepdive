# Introduction

OriginTrail is an **open protocol** that blends the power of **blockchain** technology and **knowledge graphs** to revolutionize the way **data** is managed, stored, and utilized.&#x20;

In other words, it is the combination of two technologies:

1. ****[**Knowledge Graphs**](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/) – which are advanced databases used by big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Uber to derive value from user data.
2. **Blockchain** – which enables decentralization, meaning the database is not controlled by for-profit companies.

#### The combination of knowledge graphs and blockchain creates a decentralized database which will serve as the backbone for an open, neutral and transparent application of **Artificial Intelligence**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

makes physical assets (art, healthcare, fashion, education) and digital assets (Metaverse, NFTs, blockchain, DeFi) **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**.&#x20;

OriginTrail's Decentralized Knowledge Graph, physical and digital assets, such as art, healthcare, fashion, education, and NFTs, can be discovered, verified, and leveraged for increased value and insights.

By giving users back control of their data, OriginTrail's Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) offers a level playing field where data is controlled by the users and not monopolized by for-profit companies. This ensures a more equitable distribution of the benefits of AI and promotes a more open, neutral, and transparent future for the technology.

The Decentralized Knowledge Graph accepts all d

OriginTrail is currently used by the [**British Standard Institution (BSI)**](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/)**,** [**SCAN Association**](https://www.scanassociation.com/)**,** [**The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH)**](https://wfh.org/)**,** [**EU-funded SmartAgriHubs**](https://www.smartagrihubs.eu/flagship-innovation-experiment/28-FIE-decentralised-trust-in-agrifood-supply-chains)**,** [**Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)**](https://www.sbb.ch/en)**,** [**Acala**](https://acala.network/)**,** [**PolkaDot**](https://polkadot.network/) and many more (see below).

### Let's hear a few words from the Father of Ethernet

### Dr. Bob Metcalfe

> #### “OriginTrail is going to continue to rise because the Decentralized Knowledge Graph will give AI more and more data.”

> #### “The weakness of OriginTrail is that it’s too complicated to explain to ordinary mortals. The technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people, and I’m one of them” [source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)

### A word from one of the Founders

### [Žiga Drev](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga)

#### "Data is such an integral part of our lives and it’s going to continue to become even more and more integral as we move into a more globally digitized world. As such, our mission and our core objectives are only going to become more and more important. Data needs to be trusted, it needs to be easily verifiable, and it needs to all speak the same language. There are so many use cases from this that include everything from supply chain management to certification to identification and right through to true data autonomy for the individual. What’s really needed is the protocol to do all of this, and this is what we provide and what we are continuing to perfect and fine-tune. "
