# Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** is an advanced database structure that enables the representation and sharing of knowledge in a decentralized, secure, and transparent manner. It allows multiple parties to contribute and verify information, making the knowledge graph more comprehensive and accurate.

**The application spectrum of the DKG is endless.**

In the context of AI, the DKG can **significantly improve** the **accuracy** and **reliability** of **AI models**. The structured data from the DKG enables AI models to make better predictions and decisions, while completely removing risks of hallucinations by providing sourced material. Additionally, the DKG addresses the issue of data privacy and security, as the data is decentralized and stored in a secure manner. This can increase trust in AI systems and promote their adoption. Overall, OriginTrail allows for a more comprehensive, accurate, and trustworthy data-driven AI ecosystem.

Consult this [**Twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/DrevZiga/status/1613125745911398400?s=20) by Ziga, Co-Founder of OriginTrail, for more details.

The DKG serves as an important building block for the creation of a more secure, transparent, and decentralized Internet. In other words, OriginTrail is the **Decentralized Google for Web3**. By harnessing the DKG tech, all legacy Web2 data can become connected and reuploaded into well structured Web3 assets, pairing the physical world (art, fashion, healthcare, education, supply chains, etc.) to the digital world (blockchain, DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs) and making them more **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**, while protecting **data ownership, privacy and security**. This supports the Web3 vision of a more open and transparent Internet.

In the context of supply chains, the DKG is a neutral, open source, [**GS1** ](https://www.gs1.org/)and [**W3C** ](https://www.w3.org/standards/)compliant protocol enabling secure peer-to-peer data sharing between companies and supply chains. It utilizes decentralized nodes and an off-chain technology stack to interface with legacy systems as well as other blockchains (permissioned and permissionless). OriginTrail allows businesses to improve interoperability among different IT systems by removing data silos, ensuring data integrity, immutability and traceability by fingerprinting a cryptographic data hash of the data to a blockchain and facilitating trusted data exchange.

NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent ownership of a wide range of assets, from collectibles to virtual real estate. However, NFTs face challenges in verifying original ownership and preventing unauthorized copies, complicating intellectual property and copyright enforcement. Moreover, their centralization on specific blockchain networks exacerbates accessibility issues, as participation requires familiarity and access to these particular chains, limiting wider adoption and engagement. This centralization also raises concerns about the resilience and interoperability of NFTs across different blockchain ecosystems, potentially hindering their long-term viability and inclusivity.

A Knowledge Asset represents an evolution in the NFT space, which seeks to address the current limitations of NFTs. It is structured as a dynamic and innovative resource anchored by NFT-backed ownership, ensuring verifiable authenticity through blockchain immutability proofs. Each knowledge asset has a Unique Asset Locator (UAL) for easy discovery, is organized in an AI-friendly Asset Graph (RDF), and can connect with other assets within the DKG, enhancing interconnectivity and utility. The diagram below underscores the Knowledge Asset's layered composition, highlighting its organized structure that combines ownership, verification, and discoverability.

A knowledge asset is essentially a NFT 2.0 which can be created, transfered and updated over time. The DKG enhances the protection and value of NFTs by providing a secure and transparent platform for the tracking and verification of NFT ownership and provenance, a complete history of an NFT, including details such as previous owners, creation date, and any relevant events. This information can add value to NFTs by providing a more complete picture of their history and authenticity, making them more attractive to buyers.&#x20;

As we embark into a mixed reality world,&#x20;



In the emerging mixed reality landscape where the metaverse intersects with the physical world, the importance of accurate information, data origin, and validation is paramount. Proof of Authenticity becomes crucial in this blended environment. Additionally, content creators in this new era of mixed reality stand to benefit from a digital catalog hosted on the DKG, where their creations can be used in generative AI by others in a way that encourages innovation but also ensures artists' compensation and their intellectual property rights upheld. The DKG serves as a foundational layer to facilitate these imperatives, offering a structure that supports veracity, artistic contribution, and copyright integrity.&#x20;

[**CanvasLan Metaverse Production**](https://www.canvasland.xyz/) is pioneering in the mixed reality world by adopting OriginTrail as their way to verify authenticity and traceability of source.&#x20;
