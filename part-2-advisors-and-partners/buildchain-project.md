# BUILDCHAIN Project

The BUILDCHAIN Project aims to promote the sustainability of the construction industry in the European Union. The project is supported by the [**European Union**](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092052) and is focused on developing solutions that will enable construction companies to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings, reduce their environmental impact, and promote the use of sustainable materials.

The project is led by a consortium of European companies, research institutes, and universities, and that it will use blockchain technology to create a platform that will enable construction companies to share data and collaborate more effectively. The platform will be built using OriginTrail's Decentralized Knowledge Graph, and it will enable companies to share information about the materials they use, the energy they consume, and the emissions they produce.

The BUILDCHAIN Project is part of the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, which aims to support projects that have the potential to have a significant impact on society and the economy. The goal of the project is to create a more sustainable construction industry in the EU, which will benefit both the environment and the economy.

This initiative will be a significant step forward in promoting sustainability in the construction industry and will demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to improve the transparency and traceability of materials and energy use.
