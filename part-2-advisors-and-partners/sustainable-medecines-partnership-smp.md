Trace Labs, the core development company of OriginTrail, has joined the Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP). The SMP is a global initiative that aims to promote sustainable access to medicine by fostering collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry, governments, civil society, and other stakeholders.

OriginTrail's Decentralized Knowledge Graph will be used to help ensure that medicines are sourced responsibly, delivered efficiently and effectively, and that they are safe, effective, and of good quality. Notable collaborators include Google, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Teva, Deloitte, BSI, GS1 and Honeywell.&#x20;
