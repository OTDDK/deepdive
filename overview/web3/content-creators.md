The discussion focused on the intersection of creators and artificial intelligence (AI), exploring whether AI serves as a friend or foe to the creative industries. The panel included insights from Tomas, a founder at OriginTrail, Amos Thomas from Tracverse, and Barbara LT, a visual artist. They delved into how trusted AI and decentralized technologies are being utilized to enhance creative expression and protect intellectual property.

Amos introduced the concept of Tracverse and the Maarifa Omniverse, emphasizing the importance of capturing stories on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) to preserve and interconnect creative works. He showcased how AI-generated images, when tied to a narrative and anchored on the DKG, can enrich storytelling and create an expansive, interconnected universe of creative content. This approach, he argued, democratizes creativity by enabling individuals without traditional artistic skills to contribute to storytelling and creative expression.

Barbara shared her journey from traditional oil painting to exploring digital art and discussed the practical challenges artists face, such as cataloging work and ensuring the authenticity and provenance of their creations. She highlighted how blockchain and DKG technologies offer solutions to these challenges by providing a secure, immutable record of artwork and its history. Barbara expressed optimism about AI as a tool for enhancing creativity rather than a threat to human artistry, emphasizing its potential to assist artists in new and innovative ways.

The panelists collectively highlighted the potential of AI and blockchain technologies to solve longstanding issues in the art world, such as copyright infringement and loss of provenance. They argued that these technologies, when aligned with creators' interests and integrated into the creative process, can serve as powerful allies to artists, expanding the possibilities for creative expression and ensuring fair compensation and recognition for their work.

The discussion concluded on a positive note, suggesting that the future of creativity lies in the harmonious integration of AI, blockchain, and human ingenuity. The panelists called for artists and creators to embrace these technologies, envisioning a future where AI is a friend and enabler of creative industries, enriching human expression and safeguarding the rights and contributions of creators worldwide.
