# Web3

The DKG serves as an important building block for the creation of a more secure, transparent, and decentralized Internet. In other words, OriginTrail is the **Decentralized Google for Web3**. By harnessing the DKG tech, all legacy Web2 data can become connected and reuploaded into well structured Web3 assets, pairing the physical world (art, fashion, healthcare, education, supply chains, etc.) to the digital world (blockchain, DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs) and making them more **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**, while protecting **data ownership, privacy and security**. This supports the Web3 vision of a more open and transparent Internet.
