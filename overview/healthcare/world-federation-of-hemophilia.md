Georgios Ampartzidis from the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) discussed leveraging OriginTrail technology to enhance the distribution network for hemophilia medicine donations. The use of a mobile app for barcode scanning facilitated real-time tracking of medicines from warehouses to patients, ensuring treatments are utilized efficiently and within their expiry. This system not only improves operational efficiency and donor trust but also offers a scalable model for managing medicine donations globally, potentially revolutionizing healthcare supply chains in various sectors.

Georgios Ampartzidis from the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) shared insights into utilizing OriginTrail technology to create a trusted infrastructure for tracking and managing medicine donations across 75 countries. Since 2015, Ampartzidis has been instrumental in developing a distribution network to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of hemophilia treatment medicines, with a significant focus on India due to its high demand.

WFH's strategic priorities include reaching undiagnosed patients and providing sustainable treatment support. Their efforts have expanded from a single warehouse hub in the United States to additional hubs in the European Union and India, aiming to place products closer to the areas of need and reduce transportation costs.

The challenge addressed was tracking and tracing medicine as it moves from the initial delivery points within countries to the end-users, ensuring that every vial can be accounted for from receipt to patient treatment. This effort is crucial not only for operational efficiency but also for maintaining trust with donors and complying with audit requirements.

Utilizing OriginTrail and BSI's technology, WFH developed a mobile app for barcode scanning, enabling real-time tracking and tracing of medicines from warehouses to treatment centers and eventually to patients. This system allows for the monitoring of medicine utilization, ensuring treatments are used before their expiry and accurately reporting on stock levels and usage to donors.

The data collected through this system offers invaluable insights into the distribution network's efficiency, the impact of donations on patient quality of life, and the overall success of the program. This approach highlights the potential for trusted AI to revolutionize the management of medicine donations, offering a scalable solution that could extend to other countries and medical conditions beyond hemophilia.

Ampartzidis's presentation underscores the importance of building a trusted, transparent infrastructure as a foundation for applying AI technologies in global health initiatives, particularly in the critical area of medicine donations.

The video below is strongly recommended if you are interested in the application of OriginTrail in the supply chain mangement of the healthcare sector. Note that not a single member of the OriginTrail team is presenting in that video. You are seeing BSI members David Fairnie, Paul Raw and Georgios Ampartzidis discussing the use case of OriginTrail.

The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) is a Humanitarian Aid Program that processes donations to over 22,000 patients to date to allow them to cope with Hemophilia in daily life. All donations and shipments need to respect GDP making sure that donated products are safe to be used with maximum efficiency. This is where OriginTrail open source protocol comes in (precisely at [9:55](https://youtu.be/xdjsJHVHnUs?t=595) from the video above for more details).

> “OriginTrail provides secure data exchange across supply chain networks, high level of integrity and trust, decentralized network that enables data scalability and flexibility, utilizes global standards, enables data operability and linked data that truly provides an end-to-end view. Its secured, structured and linked data then serves as a powerful base for a variety of business applications such as validation of certification, compliance checks, track and trace, etc.“
