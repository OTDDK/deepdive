By combining the transparency and immutability of the **DKG** with **AI**, healthcare providers can have a more secure and efficient way to store and manage patient data.

For instance, imagine a hospital that wants to track the health information of its patients. Using the OriginTrail DKG, the hospital can store information about the patients such as their medical history, current conditions, and treatments. By integrating AI, the hospital can then analyze this information to identify potential health risks, such as developing conditions or adverse reactions to medications, and respond to them proactively.

This improved data management and analysis can help to provide better patient care, lower costs, and reduce medical errors. It can also improve the overall quality of healthcare by allowing healthcare providers to make more informed decisions and provide more personalized treatments.

The use of OriginTrail DKG with AI has the potential to improve our lives by making the healthcare industry more secure, efficient, and effective, leading to better patient outcomes and a healthier world.
