[**SecureSystem**](https://securesystem.net/2022/06/secsysinnovatesukcustoms/) has partnered with BSI Group and the Trusted Bytes project to advance digital solutions for customs and trade-related supply chain challenges. The initiative, part of the Trusted Bytes Food Industry's Innovate UK project co-led by Melon\&Co Ltd and the University of Lincoln since April 2021, aims to digitize the UK's fresh produce supply chains to streamline international goods flow and increase the UK food sector's efficiency. Leveraging digital technology, including the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), the project enhances proof of food provenance, facilitates trusted data exchanges across the supply chain, and improves border transfer processes. This collaboration showcases future compliance assurance and risk assessment for Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) standards, enabling real-time risk assessments of incoming shipments to the UK, thereby optimizing customs processes and supporting the UK Government's future trade objectives.

Trusted Bytes is an [Innovate UK](https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/) project where BSI and Trace Labs are harnessing the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge graph to streamline international trade. Building on the fundamentals of SCAN Trusted Factory, the solution seeks to combine an enhanced Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) framework with shipment and telemetry data to provide UK customs with a comprehensive and verifiable shipment risk assessment.

Having a strong focus on interoperability, the solution is one of the first to utilize the novel GS1 EPCIS 2.0 standard for supply chain event visibility, along with RDF and SPARQL standards native to the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.
