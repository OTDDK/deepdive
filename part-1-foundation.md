# Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)** is an advanced database structure that enables the representation and sharing of knowledge in a decentralized, secure, and transparent manner. It allows multiple parties to contribute and verify information, making the knowledge graph more comprehensive and accurate.&#x20;

The application spectrum of the DKG is endless as detailed below.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## In the context of AI

The DKG can **significantly improve** the **accuracy** and **reliability** of **AI models**. AI models are trained on data and a decentralized knowledge graph provides a vast pool of data that can be used for training. This data can be diverse and more accurate, enabling the AI models to make better predictions and decisions. Additionally, a decentralized knowledge graph can help to address the issue of data privacy and security, as the data is decentralized and stored in a secure manner. This can increase trust in AI systems and promote their adoption. Overall, a decentralized knowledge graph can help to create a more comprehensive, accurate, and trustworthy data-driven AI ecosystem.

## In the context of Web 3.0

The DKG serves as an important building block for the creation of a more secure, transparent, and decentralized Internet. In other words, it is the **Decentralized Google for Web3**. By harnessing the DKG tech, all legacy Web2 data can be transformed into Web3 assets, bringing the physical world (art, fashion, healthcare, education, supply chains, etc.) to the digital world (blockchain, DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs) and making them more **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**, while protecting **data ownership, privacy and security**. This supports the Web3 vision of a more open and transparent Internet.&#x20;

## In the context of **supply chains**

The OriginTrail Decentralized Network is a neutral, open-source protocol enabling secure peer-to-peer data sharing between companies and supply chains. It utilizes decentralized nodes and an off-chain technology stack to interface with legacy systems as well as other blockchains (permissioned and permissionless). OriginTrail allows businesses to improve interoperability among different IT systems by removing data silos, ensuring data integrity, immutability and traceability by fingerprinting a cryptographic data hash of the data to a blockchain and facilitating trusted data exchange.&#x20;

## In the context of NFTs

NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent ownership of a wide range of assets, from collectibles to virtual real estate.&#x20;

The DKG enhances the protection and value of NFTs for their creators, owners, and developers by providing a secure and transparent platform for the tracking and verification of NFT ownership and provenance, ensuring that data is immutable and tamper-proof. Additionally, the knowledge graph can help to provide a complete history of an NFT, including details such as previous owners, creation date, and any relevant events. This information can add value to NFTs by providing a more complete picture of their history and authenticity, making them more attractive to buyers. NFTs can be linked to other NFTs and Web3 assets through keywords, tags, and verifiable properties, making them more discoverable.&#x20;

## In the context of Metaverse

As explained in the section above, the DKG can be used to store and manage the information related to virtual assets, such as virtual real estate, in-game items, and NFTs.

The DKG can be used to establish **connections between different metaverses**, virtual assets and digital identities within the metaverse, creating a **interconnected trustworthy and transparent web of information** that can help create a more immersive and believable virtual world.
