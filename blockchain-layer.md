# Blockchain Layer

OriginTrail combines the power of **Knowledge Graphs** and **Blockchains** to create an open protocol. However, it's important to note that **OriginTrail is not a blockchain** itself; but rather a decentralized network that operates off-chain and in conjunction with the blockchain layer. It has been designed to be interoperable with any blockchain and to act as a complementary middleware solution, addressing the issue of **data interconnectivity**. As a **layer-2 multichain and agnostic protocol**, OriginTrail can be integrated with any blockchain, providing data immutability and decentralization through blockchain technology. Currently, the OriginTrail decentralized protocol is functioning on OTP, ETH, xDAI, and MATIC blockchains.

## OriginTrail Parachain

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), a layer-0 platform, provides a secure and unified ecosystem for specialized blockchains known as parachains. These [parachains](https://parachains.info/) are separate layer-1 blockchains that run alongside each other on the Polkadot network and are connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain, accessible through [auction](https://parachains.info/auctions)-based allocation. Running a parachain on Polkadot offers numerous advantages, including shared security, increased scalability, enhanced interoperability, and collaborative governance. Additionally, the cross-chain composability feature of Polkadot enables seamless transfer of any type of data or asset between parachains, unlocking vast potential for new use cases and applications.

In 2022, the OriginTrail Decentralized Network has adopted a new Blockchain implementation, a Parachain through Polkadot auctions, OriginTrail Parachain (OTP). OriginTrail was successful in winning the  [**Polkadot Parachain auction slot #17**](https://parachains.info/details/origintrail) in May 2022, and has since then been collaborating closely with the  [Parity Technology team, who joined the Trace Alliance](https://medium.com/origintrail/parity-technologies-joins-trace-alliances-working-group-on-decentralization-and-tokenomics-8eaad2843ca7). Additionally, the OriginTrail core development team was chosen for the [the Substrate Builders program](https://www.substrate.io/builders-program/) by Parity Technologies.&#x20;

Below is the OriginTrail Parachain roadmap as of September 2022:

It is anticipated that a significant portion of network activity will occur on the OriginTrail Parachain, a blockchain that has been specifically designed for the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). This blockchain uses the layer-1 token, OTP, as both a gas token to facilitate transactions and an incentivization token to reward participants. The new iteration of OriginTrail's DKG V6 is expected to go live on other supported Blockchains, such as Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon Network in the future.&#x20;

The total token supply remains unchanged across different chains. The total supply is fixed at 500M. &#x20;
